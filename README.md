# habit_tracker

## A new Flutter project with hive backend 🛡️.

It's a similar app just like an todo app which you can see on                       and the extra ordinary  of this app is that it can keep track of your daily new habit which we do basically on daily basis. Basically  we can keep the track of the new habits which will can see by the date in the calender and we can easily modify .
Here the data will be stored locally  in the system with the help of hive backend. 👨‍💻🪄
